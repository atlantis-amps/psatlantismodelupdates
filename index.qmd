Morzaria-Luna H, Kaplan IC, Harvey CJ, Girardin R, Fulton EA, MacCready P, Chasco B, Horne P, Schmidt M. 2022. Design and Parameterization of a Spatially Explicit Atlantis Ecosystem Model for Puget Sound. Northwest Fisheries Science Center (U.S.). NOAA technical memorandum NMFS-NWFSC 177. DOI : https://doi.org/10.25923/tnp6-mf67

The model was built using the [Atlantis modeling framework](https://research.csiro.au/atlantis/), a simulation modeling approach developed by Dr. Beth Fulton at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) . Atlantis integrates physical, chemical, ecological, and anthropogenic processes in a three-dimensional, spatially explicit domain. This framework [has been applied](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.13272) to evaluate management scenarios and investigate the effects of climate change in over 30 ecosystems worldwide. In Atlantis, ecosystem dynamics are represented by spatially explicit submodels that simulate oceanographic processes, biogeochemical factors driving primary production, and food web relations among flora and fauna. The model represents species of ecological and conservation concern and key exploited species at the level of detail necessary to evaluate the direct effects of fishing, and it represents other anthropogenic and climate impacts on the ecosystem as a whole.

## Atlantis Model for Puget Sound Applications

* Explore whether top-down processes - predation and bottom-up processes—including competition and primary productivity—have led to shifts in prey availability, timing, and quality for juvenile Chinook and coho salmon. 

* Provide insight into the ecosystem effects of management actions aimed at Southern Resident Killer Whales.Turn on GitHub Pages under Settings > Pages . You will set pages to be made from the gh-pages branch and root directory.

* Examine the ecological role of increasing jellyfish populations

* Edit the repo description and Readme to add a link to the webpage. When you edit the description, you will see the link url in the url box or you can click on the Actions tab or the  Settings > Pages page to find the url.
