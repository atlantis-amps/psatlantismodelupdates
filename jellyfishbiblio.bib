  title    = "Towards end-to-end models for investigating the effects of
              climate and fishing in marine ecosystems",
  author   = "Travers, M and Shin, Y-J and Jennings, S and Cury, P",
  abstract = "End-to-end models that represent ecosystem components from
              primary producers to top predators, linked through trophic
              interactions and affected by the abiotic environment, are
              expected to provide valuable tools for assessing the effects of
              climate change and fishing on ecosystem dynamics. Here, we review
              the main process-based approaches used for marine ecosystem
              modelling, focusing on the extent of the food web modelled, the
              forcing factors considered, the trophic processes represented, as
              well as the potential use and further development of the models.
              We consider models of a subset of the food web, models which
              represent the first attempts to couple low and high trophic
              levels, integrated models of the whole ecosystem, and size
              spectrum models. Comparisons within and among these groups of
              models highlight the preferential use of functional groups at low
              trophic levels and species at higher trophic levels and the
              different ways in which the models account for abiotic processes.
              The model comparisons also highlight the importance of choosing
              an appropriate spatial dimension for representing organism
              dynamics. Many of the reviewed models could be extended by adding
              components and by ensuring that the full life cycles of species
              components are represented, but end-to-end models should provide
              full coverage of ecosystem components, the integration of
              physical and biological processes at different scales and two-way
              interactions between ecosystem components. We suggest that this
              is best achieved by coupling models, but there are very few
              existing cases where the coupling supports true two-way
              interaction. The advantages of coupling models are that the
              extent of discretization and representation can be targeted to
              the part of the food web being considered, making their
              development time- and cost-effective. Processes such as predation
              can be coupled to allow the propagation of forcing factors
              effects up and down the food web. However, there needs to be a
              stronger focus on enabling two-way interaction, carefully
              selecting the key functional groups and species, reconciling
              different time and space scales and the methods of converting
              between energy, nutrients and mass.",

               in the California Current",
  author    = "Kaplan, Isaac C and Koehn, Laura E and Hodgson, Emma E and
               Marshall, Kristin N and Essington, Timothy E",
  abstract  = "Populations of sardine, anchovy, and other forage species can
               fluctuate to low levels due to climate variability and fishing,
               leading to indirect effects on marine food webs. In the context
               of recent declines of sardine (Sardinops sagax) and anchovy
               (Engraulis mordax) in the California Current, we apply an
               end-to-end Atlantis ecosystem model that is spatially explicit,
               includes trophic interactions, and allows high and low
               recruitment regimes (production of juveniles). Our simulations
               suggest that depleted sardine populations, whether caused by
               fishing or natural cycles, may lead to declines in predator
               groups such as dolphins and large piscivorous flatfish (e.g.
               California halibut Paralichthys californicus). Birds exhibited
               more moderate declines, and California sea lions (Zalophus
               californianus) exhibited relatively weak declines. The Atlantis
               ecosystem model also predicted indirect positive effects of
               sardine depletion, primarily for prey species such as
               zooplankton. Overall our model predicted moderate declines in
               most predators during simulated severe declines in sardine and
               anchovy, illustrating the important buffering role provided by
               forage species other than sardine and anchovy. This `buffered
               response' is weaker than what would be suggested by another
               ecosystem model (Ecosim), as predicted by diet information and a
               global synthesis of Ecosim models (the PREP equation). One
               limitation of the Atlantis model is that it did not include
               processes that might give rise to localized depletion of sardine
               at scales relevant to central place foragers, such as birds and
               pinnipeds. This analysis will contribute to a collaborative
               multi-model approach that evaluates the role of sardine in the
               California Current.",

              oceans are threatened by numerous global change stressors, one of
              which is ocean acidification. Here, we describe the effects of
              ocean acidification on an upwelling system that already
              experiences inherently low pH conditions, the California Current.
              We used an end-to-end ecosystem model (Atlantis), forced by
              downscaled global climate models and informed by a meta-analysis
              of the pH sensitivities of local taxa, to investigate the direct
              and indirect effects of future pH on biomass and fisheries
              revenues. Our model projects a 0.2-unit drop in pH during the
              summer upwelling season from 2013 to 2063, which results in
              wide-ranging magnitudes of effects across guilds and functional
              groups. The most dramatic direct effects of future pH may be
              expected on epibenthic invertebrates (crabs, shrimps, benthic
              grazers, benthic detritivores, bivalves), and strong indirect
              effects expected on some demersal fish, sharks, and epibenthic
              invertebrates (Dungeness crab) because they consume species known
              to be sensitive to changing pH. The model's pelagic community,
              including marine mammals and seabirds, was much less influenced
              by future pH. Some functional groups were less affected to
              changing pH in the model than might be expected from experimental
              studies in the empirical literature due to high population
              productivity (e.g., copepods, pteropods). Model results suggest
              strong effects of reduced pH on nearshore state-managed
              invertebrate fisheries, but modest effects on the groundfish
              fishery because individual groundfish species exhibited diverse
              responses to changing pH. Our results provide a set of
              projections that generally support and build upon previous
              findings and set the stage for hypotheses to guide future

               model, NEUSv2 includes changes to the model's functional group
               definitions and forcing data. NEUSv2 is the first Atlantis model
               to use a satellite-ocean-color-derived phytoplankton size class
               model that was tuned specifically for the region to force marine
               primary production. Additionally, physical ocean variables
               (currents, temperature, and salinity) were updated using a
               high-resolution global ocean reanalysis. Despite its coarse
               resolution, NEUSv2 was capable of reproducing the broad spatial
               patterns seen in the physical and biological forcing sources,
               with the exception of some circulation features. NEUSv2 produced
               plausible zooplankton and planktivore biomass, a stable lower

               NEUSv2 meets calibration criteria for the persistence and
               long-term stability of functional group biomass. Given the

              surface and bottom temperatures. Defined as scyphozoans,
              siphonophores, ctenophores, and salps, the abundance of GZ on the

              Conservative estimates of annual removal of GZ by spiny dogfish
              ranged from approximately 0.3?298 g individual?1 with spiny
              dogfish being the primary GZ feeder sampled on the shelf. The

               of the United States has been viewed as a success; however,
               within Puget Sound in Washington State, the increased abundance

               riverine nutrient load changes, taking into account the
               interactions of the full food web in the entire Baltic Sea. This
               was done to identify which of those two pressures will likely

               and 3 nutrient load scenarios, using two sources of nutrient
               forcing and predict likely trends in ecosystem effects. With
               focus on major fish stocks, our model, with its assumptions,
               indicated that nutrient loads are the main driver of the changes

               spawning are not reached. If the thresholds are reached for the

               Furthermore, higher nutrient loads resulted in cod decrease, and
               increase in sprat and herring. This effect is amplified by
               stronger climate change. Overall, it is of crucial importance

              Examples drawn from existing models can be used to give guidance

              and greatest complexity in all the dimensions (e.g. spatial,
